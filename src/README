After creating the JAR files, I've imported the JAR files into Eclipse again. 
I've checked that there's no compilation error. I will lose 50% if that's 
not the case.

To run this application it should be run through Eclipse with jre7 installed.

No third-party Java packages were used other then the four for the project.
